# Dialog Engine (Gamemaker Studio 2.3)
A Dialog system that uses both scribble and chatterbox. Uses scribble v7.0.3 and chatterbox v1.0.0

Dialog System Features:
  
  - Text warping 
  - Pagination
  - Choices
  - Staring Font and Color
  - Typewritter Effect and Instant Text
  - Portraits

Warning: this system here is specifically meant for my project and is only meant as a guide for anyone to combine scribble and chatterbox together into a powerful Dialog System. Also this code makes great use of region code-folding for organization purposes, open this up in gamemaker studio or any code editor (no, notepad does not count) in order to fold certain sections of code. This repo only contains the dialog engine code and not scribble and chatterbox libraries, you must get them seperately: https://github.com/JujuAdams/scribble and https://github.com/JujuAdams/chatterbox.
