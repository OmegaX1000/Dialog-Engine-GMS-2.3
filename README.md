# Dialog-Engine-GMS-2.3
A Dialog system that uses both scribble and chatterbox.

Dialog System Features:
  
  - Text warping 
  - Pagination
  - Choices
  - Staring Font and Color
  - Typewritter Effect and Instant Text
  - Portraits

Warning: this system here is specifically meant for my project and is only meant as a guide for anyone to combine scribble and chatterbox together into a powerful Dialog System. Also this code makes great use of region code-folding for organization purposes, open this up in gamemaker studio or any code editor (no, notepad does not count) in order to fold certain sections of code.
